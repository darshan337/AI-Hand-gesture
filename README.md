# AI-Hand-gesture
As we know, the vision-based technology of hand gesture recognition is an important part of human-computer interaction (HCI). In the last decades, keyboard and mouse play a significant role in human-computer interaction. However, owing to the rapid development of hardware and software, new types of HCI methods have been required. In particular, technologies such as speech recognition and gesture recognition receive great attention in the field of HCI.  Gesture is a symbol of physical behavior or emotional expression. It includes body gesture and hand gesture. It falls into two categories: static gesture [1–4] and dynamic gesture [5–8]. For the former, the posture of the body or the gesture of the hand denotes a sign. For the latter, the movement of the body or the hand conveys some messages. Gesture can be used as a tool of communication between computer and human [9–11]. It is greatly different from the traditional hardware based methods and can accomplish human-computer interaction through gesture recognition. Gesture recognition determines the user intent through the recognition of the gesture or movement of the body or body parts. In the past decades, many researchers have strived to improve the hand gesture recognition technology. Hand gesture recognition has great value in many applications such as sign language recognition [12–15], augmented reality (virtual reality) [16–19], sign language interpreters for the disabled [20], and robot control [21, 22].
